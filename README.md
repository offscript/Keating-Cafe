# Keating-Cafe
HTML/CSS/JQuery/API Project

A project for the fictional Keating Technology Cafe, your typical coffee shop with a developer twist. Constructed with Twitter's Bootstrap, the divs, with the exception of the Google Maps API plugin are added on page load with jQuery. On hover the divs display in a nice "hacker"-themed green, black, and white. Enjoy it here: https://offscript.github.io/Keating-Cafe/!
