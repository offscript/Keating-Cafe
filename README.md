# Keating-Cafe
HTML/CSS/JQuery/API Project

A project for the fictional Keating Technology Cafe, your typical coffee shop with a developer twist. Most of the divs are added on page load with jQuery. On hover the div's display in a nice"hacker"-themed green, black, and white. There's also a Google Maps plugin showing the location of Keating Cafe.
